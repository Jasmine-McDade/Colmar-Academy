        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <div class="bio">   
            <h3>How i got started</h3>
                <p>In 2018 I started a business making skincare products. Nothing made me happier than when I was making body butter for my customers. 
                    Well.. except when I was making the product labels, photoshopping my product photos, and creating graphics to put on my social media. 
                    My customers loved my products, and I loved getting feedback on my products and label designs.</p>
            <h3>Freelance Career</h3>
                    <p>Then in the early part of 2021, the pandemic happened, and many people started creating their own businesses after losing their jobs. 
                    My inbox was flooded with so many people asking me to create logos and labels for their products. Then I eventually moved into designing 
                    websites for other companies after building my own website for my business.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>    
                    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and reading. Some of my favorite dishes include Salisbury steak with rice, growing all times 
                    of squash and tomatoes, and reading series by Anne Rice.</p>
